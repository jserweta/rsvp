### RSVP form

The RSVP form is linked to an invitation. Each invitation has members that will be displayed in the form. In the dashboard, you can specify whether you want to ask someone if they need accommodation or transportation to the event.
Once all the steps are completed and the form is submitted, the data is saved in the database (you can review it in the dashboard).
